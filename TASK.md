  - [ ] Write frontend unit/integration tests (Jest).
  - [ ] Configure Supabase Auth settings (Providers, Templates, Security).
  - [ ] Set `user_role` in user_metadata for users.
  - [ ] Deployment setup (Frontend app distribution).
  - [ ] Implement Responsive Layouts (Tablet/Phone).
- **2025-04-07:** Implement Nested Groups in Estimate Builder:
  - [x] Refactor `EstimateBuilderContext` state to use hierarchical tree structure.
  - [x] Implement logic to transform flat Supabase data *to* the tree structure (`buildTreeFromFlatData`).
  - [x] Create a recursive `<EstimateNodeDisplay>` component for rendering groups and items.
  - [x] Implement `addNode` logic in context (local state).
  - [x] Implement `updateNode` logic in context (local state).
  - [x] Implement `deleteNode` logic in context (local state, includes re-indexing).
  - [x] Update calculation logic to traverse the tree.
  - [x] Add `title` field to item form and save logic.
  - [x] Change `unit` field to Picker in item form.
  - [x] Remove `unit_price` field from item form, display calculated cost.
  - [x] Adjust `editable` props in item form.
  - [x] Fix `quote_id` null error when saving new items.
  - [x] Fix provider scope issues causing errors/state loss.
  - [x] **BUG:** Fix `Text strings must be rendered within a <Text>` error after adding item. (Fixed 2025-04-15)
    - **Problem:** Text rendering errors occurred in CustomerDetailScreen when viewing customers with related jobs/estimates. The issue was in the FlatList's renderItem function where text strings weren't properly nested within <Text> components, especially in conditional rendering and complex expressions.
    - **Solution:** Ensured all text strings were properly wrapped in nested <Text> components, particularly in the renderItem function of the FlatList. Fixed the name/ID display, status display, and date display with proper nesting. Also fixed the ListEmptyComponent to avoid duplicate content when there are no related quotes.
  - [ ] **BUG:** Fix Total Cost calculation not updating UI correctly.
  - [ ] **BUG:** Fix `handleAddGroup` prompt/logic.
  - [x] **BUG:** Decimal input not working in cost fields. (Fixed 2025-04-09 with separate string state)
  - [x] **BUG:** Fix navigation back from EstimateBuilder when accessed from CustomerDetailScreen. (Fixed 2025-04-15)
    - **Problem:** When navigating from CustomerDetailScreen to EstimateBuilderScreen (cross-stack navigation), the back button was not appearing or not working correctly, preventing users from returning to the customer details.
    - **Solution:** 
      1. Modified CustomerDetailScreen to navigate directly to EstimateBuilder with the estimateId parameter
      2. Updated EstimateBuilderScreen to use the default back button (arrow) for consistent navigation
      3. Added logic to handle different navigation scenarios based on the navigation state
  - [x] **FEATURE:** Add ability to navigate to JobDetail from CustomerDetailScreen for job deletion. (Added 2025-04-15)
    - **Implementation:**
      1. Modified CustomerDetailScreen to fetch job_id for each estimate
      2. Added conditional navigation to either JobDetail or EstimateBuilder based on whether the item is a job
      3. Added visual indicators (üî®/üìù) to distinguish between jobs and estimates
      4. Added a legend to explain the icons and which items can be deleted
  - [x] **FEATURE:** Add ability to delete estimates from EstimateBuilderScreen. (Added 2025-04-15)
    - **Implementation:**
      1. Added a "Delete Estimate" button to the EstimateBuilderScreen
      2. Implemented deletion logic with confirmation dialog
      3. Added cascading deletion to remove all related quote items and groups before deleting the quote itself
      4. Added navigation back to previous screen after successful deletion
  - [x] **BUG:** Fix navigation and refresh issues after deleting jobs/estimates. (Fixed 2025-04-15)
    - **Problem:** After deleting a job or estimate, the app would navigate to the wrong screen or not refresh the customer detail screen to show the updated list of jobs/estimates.
    - **Solution:**
      1. Fixed navigation in JobDetailScreen to return to CustomerDetailScreen after deleting a job
      2. Fixed navigation in EstimateBuilderScreen to return to CustomerDetailScreen after deleting an estimate
      3. Added useFocusEffect hook to CustomerDetailScreen to refresh related quotes when the screen comes into focus
      4. Fixed infinite loop issues in EstimateBuilderScreen by removing selectedCustomer from dependency arrays
      5. Added useFocusEffect hook to JobsScreen and EstimatesScreen to refresh data when navigating back to these screens
  - [ ] **FEATURE:** Add ability to delete multiple jobs/estimates at once. (Requested 2025-04-15)
    - **Implementation Plan:**
      1. Add multi-select mode to CustomerDetailScreen with long press to activate
      2. Add checkbox selection for each job/estimate item
      3. Add delete button that appears when items are selected
      4. Implement batch deletion logic with confirmation dialog
      5. Add toggle in settings to enable/disable this feature for testing
  - [ ] Implement `handleEditItem` trigger in `EstimateNodeDisplay`.
  - [ ] Implement `handleEditGroup` handler and UI trigger.
  - [x] Implement `handleDeleteNode` handler and UI trigger (with confirmation). (Added confirmation alert 2025-04-09)
  - [ ] Implement `moveNode` logic (re-parenting & re-ordering).
  - [ ] Implement `handleMoveNode` handler and UI trigger.
  - [ ] Implement logic to save tree changes back to Supabase.
  - [ ] Add unit tests.
  - [ ] Refine button styling.
